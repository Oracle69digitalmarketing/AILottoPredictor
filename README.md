# AI Lotto Predictor

This project is a mobile application that uses an AI-powered backend to predict lottery numbers, built with a focus on a modern, developer-friendly, and cost-effective stack.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:

1.  **Frontend**: A React Native application located in the `AILottoPredictorApp` directory. This app is responsible for displaying the lottery predictions to the user.
2.  **Backend**: A Python serverless function in the `api` directory, designed to be deployed on Vercel. It uses Supabase for data storage and the DeepSeek API for AI-powered predictions.

### Backend Details

-   **Hosting**: The serverless function is deployed on **Vercel**.
-   **Data Source**: It reads historical lottery results from a local CSV file (`babaijeburesults.csv`) included in the `api` directory.
-   **AI Model**: It calls the **DeepSeek V3** model (`deepseek-chat`) via their OpenAI-compatible API.
-   **Data Storage**: Predictions are stored in a PostgreSQL database managed by **Supabase**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js and npm**: For the React Native app.
-   **React Native development environment**: See the [official guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment).
-   **Vercel Account**: To deploy the backend.
-   **Supabase Account**: To create the database.
-   **DeepSeek Account**: To get an API key for the AI model.

### Backend Setup (Vercel & Supabase)

**Step 1: Set up Supabase**

1.  Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the following script to create the `LottoPredictions` table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE "LottoPredictions" (
        "id" bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        "GameName" text,
        "PredictionDate" timestamp with time zone,
        "TopNumbers" jsonb,
        "Probabilities" jsonb,
        "ModelVersion" text
    );
    ```
3.  Go to **Project Settings > API**. Find your **Project URL** and your **`service_role` Key**. You will need these for the environment variables.

**Step 2: Get a DeepSeek API Key**

1.  Go to the [DeepSeek API Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/) and create an account.
2.  Navigate to the API keys section and generate a new API key.

**Step 3: Deploy to Vercel**

1.  Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project, linking it to your forked repository.
3.  During the project setup, configure the following **Environment Variables**:
    -   `SUPABASE_URL`: The Project URL you got from Supabase.
    -   `SUPABASE_KEY`: The `service_role` key you got from Supabase.
    -   `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: The API key you got from DeepSeek.
4.  Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` file and deploy the serverless function. Once deployed, you will get a production URL.

### Frontend Setup

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

1.  Navigate to the `AILottoPredictorApp` directory:
    ```sh
    cd AILottoPredictorApp
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

**Step 2: Update the API Endpoint**

1.  Open `AILottoPredictorApp/src/PredictionView.tsx`.
2.  Find the `API_URL` constant and replace the placeholder URL with your actual Vercel deployment URL. Make sure to append `/api/predict` to the end of the URL.
    ```javascript
    // Example
    const API_URL = 'https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/predict';
    ```

**Step 3: Run the Application**

1.  Run the Metro server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2.  In a new terminal, run the application on your desired platform:
    -   For Android: `npm run android`
    -   For iOS: `npm run ios`
